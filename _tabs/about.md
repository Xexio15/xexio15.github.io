I am Sergio, I born in the 1996 (please, do your maths so I don't need to update this every year), I work as a Cybersecuirity Analyst since 1 year ago, currently working as Application Security Analyst.

Taking advantadge that I'm practically new in this world I hope to mantain this site as a way to see my improvements through the years, and, if everything goes well, to help other people who starts in cybersecurity.
